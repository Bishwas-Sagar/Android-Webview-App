This script performs the same tasks as the original one, but with the following improvements:

1. It uses `subprocess.check_call` to install dependencies, which raises an exception if the installation fails.
2. It uses `Cython.Build.cythonize` to compile the Cython source files, which automatically generates C files and adds them to the extension list.
3. It defines a custom `build_ext` command to perform additional build steps if necessary.
4. It uses `setuptools.setup` to create a source distribution package.
5. It uses `subprocess.check_call` to upload the package to PyPI, which raises an exception if the upload fails.
6. It cleans up temporary files after the build process is complete.

Note that you should replace `myproject/mymodule.pyx` with the actual Cython source file(s) for your project, and update the `package_name` variable to match your project's name.
